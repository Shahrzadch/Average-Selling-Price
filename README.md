**Average Selling Price**


There is a table named Prices with 4 fields. product_id, start_date, end_date, and price. (product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.
We have other table named UnitSold with 3 fields of product_id, purchase_date, and units.
This table may contain duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates the date, units, and product_id of each product sold.
